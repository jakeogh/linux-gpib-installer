### Description:
[linux-gpib-installer](https://github.com/jakeogh/linux-gpib-installer) compiles and installs GPIB/[VISA](https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) using open source drivers from the [linux-gpib](https://linux-gpib.sourceforge.io/) project.

It is an automated implementation of the instructions by [jonathanschilling](https://gist.github.com/jonathanschilling/07defddc272fe35c7412d51dffa0bb6f) which install [drogenlied/linux-gpib-dkms](https://github.com/drogenlied/linux-gpib-dkms).

Currently only[ยน](#gentoo-note) [Debian 11](https://www.linuxtechi.com/how-to-install-debian-11-bullseye/) (aka Bullseye) is supported.

Automatic `/etc/gpib.conf` configuration is done for the National Instruments [GPIB-USB-HS](https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z000000P8kcSAC) USB dongle, if you are using a PCI card (after following the instructions below), see `/etc/gpib.conf.example` and make the appropriate changes to `/etc/gpib.conf`.
